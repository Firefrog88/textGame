# textGame

My own fancy new game, (trying) to use the most recent Object Oriented Programming standards.
<div style="text-align: justify">
The most relevant aspect of this implementation is the use of the Nlohmann/json library (via 'json.hpp') to solve lots of problems creatively: for instance, specifications for styling a box printed in the terminal are sent via a json object which includes things like 'padding' or 'color'.
